		<section name="Mavento - Magento development with Maven.">
			<subsection name="Overview">
				<p>
					Mavento is, for the most part, a Maven plugin to build, test and deploy Magento projects.
					It was
					started to achieve continous integration for
					Magento
					projects,
					but
					has since matured into a solid toolbox for
					Magento
					developers of
					all kind.
					The magento-maven-plugin provides
					Magento
					specific <a href="plugin-info.html" target="_blank">goals</a>
					which
					can be
					plugged into the Maven build life
					cycle
					or
					run from any
					shell.
					The
					magento-archetypes provide ready to run
					Maven
					projects
					configured
					for Magento development.
					<br />

					All projects are open source and can be found on
					<a href="https://github.com/edannenberg" target="_blank">github</a>
					.

			<subsection name="Why Maven?">
				<p>
					Maven is a software project
					management and comprehension tool that aims at providing
					a uniform
					and easy build process. It is very popular in the Java
					world, but
					can handle any type of project,
					be it java, c++, php, ios, simple
					static html or even authoring a
					print book.
					<br />
					<br />
					
					Apart from this holistic approach, Maven follows the convention
					over configuration paradigm, provides excellent dependency
					management and is designed in an extremly modular fashion. 
					The benefits of Maven get substantial once you
					have to work/integrate with an increasing number of different projects or as your
					organisation grows.
