			<subsection name="Overview">
				<p>
				The snippet goal (ab)uses a feature of Maven called partial archetypes. As the name implies
				they are not meant to provide a full project but rather supplement it. 
				<br/>
				This makes them ideal for code snippets and such. 
				<br/><br/>
				As i just recently implemented the goal, there is only one simple snippet at the moment, which will add a 
				Magento database model to your project. 
				<br/>
				It is however extremely easy to create your own snippets and i would love to see this grow into a nice database
				of Magento code snippets.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Usage">
				<p>
				You will need a running Maven project, look <a href="../howto/single_module.html">here</a> if you need one.
				<br/><br/>
				Invoke the snippet goal:
				
				<source>
mvn magento:snippet</source>
				
				Maven will look into your local and remote repositories and present you with a list of Magento code snippets.
				At the time of writing, the selection is rather limited, so go ahead and pick the <b>magento-simple-model-snippet</b>.
				The plugin will try to guess the existing Magento modulename/namespace and such, you can however enter your own
				values should the presented defaults not be correct. Then enter the name of your new database model to finish snippet creation.
				The post install message will tell you which files you need to merge with existing config files.
				
				<br/><br/>
				<b>NOTE</b>: A snippet can never overwrite an existing file in your project. The plugin will throw an error in such a case.
